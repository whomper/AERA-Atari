ONE SENTENCE: what it is, for which Ataris. *(e.g. "A calendar for the Atari ST, STE, TT and Falcon,
written in C for GEM.")*

**Highlights**

- **THE MAIN THING:** one line on what it does best.
- **Modern but Atari:** desk accessory and program, right-click menus, drag and drop, iconify, help in
  EHypView/ST-Guide (keep what is true).
- **Secure:** TLS 1.2 on the Falcon and TT; ST and STE through a Raspberry Pi gateway (networked apps
  only).
- **Hebrew**, in the Atari character set (when supported).

## Getting started

Download the latest `ENAME-x.y.zip` from **[Releases](../../releases/latest)** and unpack it. It contains:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `ENAME.PRG` / `ENAME.ACC` | Falcon and TT: with Falcon mode (TLS, DSP) |
| `ENAMEST.PRG` / `ENAMEST.ACC` | ST and STE: the same without TLS, through the Pi gateway |
| `ENAME.HYP`, `ENAME.REF` | the help, for EHypView or ST-Guide |
| `CACERT.PEM`, `ROOTS.DAT` | root certificates for Falcon mode |

1. Copy `ENAME.ACC` to the root of your boot drive (or start `ENAME.PRG` from anywhere).
2. ...
3. Press **Help** in EName for the guide.

**Needs:** TOS 1.04 or newer, MagiC, N.AES or XaAES; 640×200 or larger; RAM; network: STinG or MiNTnet.

**Under TOS, put Atari's `FOLDR100.PRG` first in `AUTO`**, renamed for more room (`FOLDR400.PRG`).
TOS keeps an entry in a small internal pool for every folder a program or accessory has looked
into, and halts with "OUT OF INTERNAL MEMORY" when it runs out; FOLDRxxx makes the pool bigger.

*(Networked apps.)* **With STinG, set the Delay in `STING.CPX` to suit the machine:** 10 on a
Falcon or TT, 25 to 50 on an ST, as STinG's manual says. STinG looks at the network card that
often, so it sets the speed of every STinG program: on Erez's Falcon with a NetUSBee, Delay 10
took EFTP's downloads from 40 to 75 KB/s. On a NetUSBee, keep STinG's TCP receive window at 5840
(MSS 1460): the card holds about four full packets.

## How it reaches the servers

*(Networked apps only.)* Which edition connects how, with the same diagram style as ECal:

```
ST, STE:     Atari (ENAMEST) --plain, home LAN--> Raspberry Pi (gateway) --TLS--> the server
Falcon, TT:  Atari (ENAME, TLS 1.2, RSA on the DSP) ---------------------TLS--> the server
```

The gateway's own README: [`gateway/`](gateway/).

## Building

```sh
sudo apt install gcc-m68k-linux-gnu python3   # Debian/Ubuntu; no MiNTLib needed
make            # binary/ENAME.PRG, ENAME.ACC, ENAMEST.*
make test       # unit tests on this computer, plus the gateway's tests
make itest      # against a local server (SERVER-NAME)
make dist       # dist/ENAME-x.y.zip, as on the Releases page
make help HCP=/path/to/hcp   # ENAME.HYP from docs/GUIDE.md (hcp: github.com/th-otto/hypview)
```

`binary/` and `dist/` are what make builds; they are never committed, and a build changes no tracked
file. A release: `tools/bump.py`, commit and push, then **Actions > Release > Run workflow** on `main`
with what is new. The workflow tests, builds, tags the commit `vX.Y` and publishes the
files and the zip on the Releases page. Builds in between are never handed out: to try a change, release it.

## Source

```
src/        the program's core, also built for this computer in the tests
ui/         GEM: windows, dialogs, menus
atari/      the Atari runtime (from the shared AERA library)
gateway/    the Raspberry Pi gateway (networked apps)
tests/      host unit tests (tests/host) and Hatari rigs (tests/hatari)
tools/      build helpers: TOS header, icons, help file, version bump
docs/       the user guide (GUIDE.md, the source of ENAME.HYP) and pictures
```

## Tests

What `make test` covers. How to run the Hatari rigs, and which emulated machines they use.
